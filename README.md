Build your first Gutenberg Editor block! A boilerplate to build WP Gutenberg blocks and stuff! ✊

## ⚡️ Getting Started


1. ✅ Install & activate the [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/) WordPress plugin
2. ✅ Then download and install/activate this [Gutenberg Boilerplate plugin](https://github.com/ahmadawais/Gutenberg-Boilerplate/archive/master.zip) ← Just click this link to download.
3. 🙊 All blocks added by this boilerplate are prefixed with `GB` as in Gutenberg-Boilerplate. Take a look at the GIFs below to see how to try 'em out.
4. 🎯 To try the ESNext block, i.e. `02-basic-esnext` go to it's directory i.e.  `gutenberg-boilerpalte/block/02-basic-esnext` and run `npm install`. Make sure you have [Node and npm installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Then in the `02-basic-esnext` directory run `npm run dev` for development or `npm run build` to build the production code.
4. 💯 Now read the source code to learn how to build blocks. It's heavily documented.

Sure thing! Here are a few examples of how you can use this WordPress plugin. When you install it after installing the Gutenberg plugin, this plugin gives you following four additional blocks.

## ⚡️ License & Attribution

Code is licensed under GPL v3.0. The content and documentation is copyrighted to the WordPress Gutenberg team and WGA - AhmadAwais.com (especially the content in the blog post). I am still making up my mind with how Gutenberg will fit in the WordPress core. There are so many things which are both good and bad about it. So, instead of ranting about it, I wanted to do something more productive. I went ahead, studied the source code and received a lot of help from [Gutenberg](https://github.com/wordpress/gutenberg) project and its contributors (Matias Ventura, James Nylen, Riad Benguella, Andrew Duthie, Joen, etc.) to finally build this. I started with three different repos which now co-exist as the Gutenberg examples and added more examples and documentation, using the Gutenberg code as a reference. Thanks to the Gutenberg team for a lot of help along the way.
